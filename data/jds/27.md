The Azure Networking team continues to innovate across the stack, pushing new scale and features into the cloud and desktop platforms while transforming our infrastructure to meet the growing needs of the 200-plus Microsoft online services, including Bing, MSN, Office 365, Xbox Live, Skype, OneDrive and several hundred thousand customers using Azure to host and run their Cloud Services in over 100 datacenters, running millions of servers and edge computing nodes all over the world. Our teams work on the breadth of networking offerings (Networking hardware, optical and IP networks that span subsea, terrestrial and metro fiber, Hybrid services enabling VPN and MPLS connectivity from customers' on premise network to our cloud, Edge services enabling optimized peering and routing, SDN products to enable customers to run their on-premise services in the cloud with Virtual Networks, Load Balancers, Security Groups and Services, Application Gateways, Virtual Appliances to easily mimic on-premise architectures, and DNS services to reach and traffic manage services.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables customers to realize and control the network they desire for their workload in the cloud. This includes traditional enterprise network functions like ACLs, firewalls, load balancers, IPS/IDS, DoS protection, that customers want to realize in the network for their VMs in the cloud. All these need to be delivered on a shared, very high speed but low-complexity physical network based on merchant silicon. And that is where the software comes in - all this can be realized and delivered in software by building a virtual network on top of physical network, using the virtualized host as the scale-out engine for all our policies, allowing the underlying physical network to be cheap and extremely fast. Creating a new, software controlled virtualized network, optimized for the cloud, represents a once-in-ten-years technological shift. The entire industry is realizing the SDN vision and jumping into it.

As a Software Engineer in SDN, you will be front and center of the two key disruptions happening: cloud and SDN. You will be a part of the overall Microsoft Azure team responsible for building the highly available, robust and large-scale virtual network technology in cloud. You will be stretched to grow in your design and implementation skills as an engineer as you work on a service used by millions of customers every day - a service needing continuous innovation to improve feature offerings, agility, reliability, performance, scale and cost effectiveness. This opportunity will allow you to accelerate your career growth, develop deep technical insight, hone your skills as a modern stack software engineer.

Microsoftâ€™s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
